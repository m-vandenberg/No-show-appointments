# No Show Appointment - Investigation
## by Monique van den Berg

## Dataset

The dataset contains information centered around the question of whether or not a patient attended their medical appointment in Brazil.
The dataset contains information such as the patients age, gender, pre-existing conditions, welfare status, scholarship status,
when the appointment was made, the date of the appointment, the location of the appointment, whether the patient received an sms
and if the patient attended their appointment.

## Summary of Findings

Results: Our data implies that
* Appointments are missed by 20.2% of patients.
* 20% of male and female patients missed their appointment.
* A patient with a pre-existing condition (diabetes, hypertension or who is handicapped) is 2-3% more likely to attend their appointment
than a patient without a pre-existing condition.
* A patient who received an sms is 10% more likely to miss their appointment than a patient who didn't receive an sms.
* A patient with a scholarship is 4% more likely to miss their appointment than a patient without a scholarship.
* A patient who is below 2 and above 39 years of age is 5-10% more likely to attend their appointment than a patient who is 3 to 39 years
of age.

Limitations: Our data has a few limitations
* 8 of the 14 columns contained categorical data.
* We are missing details for some of the columns, which might aid in being able to draw conclusions.
For example an explanation of the patient and appointment id would be useful, does the value contain the reason for the appointment or 
whether the patient has a pre-existing condition. Another example of missing detail is the sms_received column: was this a reminder sms 
sent to all the patients or only a subset of the patients, when was this sms sent. A final example of missing detail would be the 
appointment day column which doesn't have the appointment time, which might be an important factor in missing/attending the appointment.
